  "Name": "Hackmanite",
  "Description": "Hackmanite is a pink, pale to deep violet variety of Sodalite, but the colour fades quickly to greyish or greenish white in sunlight (so-called tenebrescence). Some hackmanites (from Afghanistan and Burma) start off creamy white but develop a violet to pink-red colour in sunlight, which can fade again if left in a dark environment for some time.\r\n\r\nIt was first discovered in cuttable qualities in 1991, in Quebec, Canada.",
