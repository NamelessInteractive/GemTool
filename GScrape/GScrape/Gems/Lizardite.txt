  "Name": "Lizardite",
  "Description": "Lizardite is named after its discovery locality, in Kennack Cove, The Lizard, Cornwall, England.\r\n\r\nLizardite is the most common serpentine species. It forms extremely fine-grained scales and massive aggregates, very rarely crystals up to 2 mm of green, light yellow to white, colorless to pale green colour.\r\n\r\nLizardite is used for ornamental carvings.",
