  "Name": "Clinozoisite",
  "Description": "Clinozoisite was discovered in 1896 in Tyrol, Austria, and is named because of its monoclinic crystallography and resemblance to zoisite.\r\n\r\nClinozoisite is colourless, yellow, greenish or pale rose-red mineral similar to Epidote, but containing little iron.",
