  "Name": "Vesuvianite (Idocrase)",
  "Description": "Vesuvianite is named after the Mount Vesuvius, where it was first discovered in 1795.\r\n\r\nIt is also called Idocrase (Greek - mixed form) with reference to the fact that its crystals usually combine the forms of other minerals.\r\n\r\nVesuvianite can be faceted or used in its massive form as a substitute for jade.",
