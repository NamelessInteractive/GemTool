  "Name": "Cobaltite",
  "Description": "Cobaltite is named after its cobalt content.\r\n\r\nCobaltite forms opaque silvery-white to reddish or greyish black pseudocubic or pseudopyritohedral crystals or granular masses.\r\n\r\nCobaltite is rarely faceted. Massive material is used for cabochons.",
