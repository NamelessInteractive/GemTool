  "Name": "Diopside",
  "Description": "Diopside is named after Greek word for \"double appearance\" because of its crystal shape. It is one of the most common members of the Pyroxene Group.\r\n\r\nDiopside has a number of gem-quality varieties, including intense green Chrome diopside and fine blue Violane. Black diopside exhbiiting asterism or the Star effect is known.\r\n\r\nUsual weight of cut stones is 1 - 20 carats. Compact fine-grained varieties are used as jewelry-industrial stone.",
