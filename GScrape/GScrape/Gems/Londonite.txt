  "Name": "Londonite",
  "Description": "Londonite is named after Dr. David London, Professor of Geology and Geophysics, University of Oklahoma, Norman, Oklahoma, USA, for his contributions to the understanding of granite pegmatites.\r\n\r\nLondonite forms colourless, white, sulfur-yellow, pale yellow, pale yellow-green crystals with vitreous lustre.\r\n\r\nLondonite is a very rare gem - it is found only in a very limited series of pegmatites in Madagascar. Gemmy faceted material is rare.",
