  "Name": "Morganite",
  "Description": "Morganite is named after the American banker and collector J.P Morgan.\r\n\r\nMorganite, also known as \"pink beryl\", \"rose beryl\", \"pink emerald\", and \"cesian (or caesian) beryl\", is a rare light pink to rose-coloured gem-quality variety of beryl. Orange/yellow varieties of morganite can also be found, and colour banding is common.\r\n\r\nThe pink colour of Morganite is unstable and fades when heated to 500Â°C. The colour can be restored by radioactive bombardment.",
