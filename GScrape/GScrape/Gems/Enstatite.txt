  "Name": "Enstatite",
  "Description": "Enstatite is named after Greek word for \"resistor\", because it resists high temperatures.\r\n\r\nClear transparent specimens can be faceted. Greenish-gray enstatite cat's eye ans star enstatite are known.\r\n\r\nEnstatite has been identified in some meteorites. It is thought to be one of the early stages for the formation of crystalline silicates in Space.",
