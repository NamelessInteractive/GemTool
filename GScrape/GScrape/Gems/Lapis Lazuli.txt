  "Name": "Lapis Lazuli",
  "Description": "Lapis Lazuli (Arabic and Latin - blue stone) can be described as an impure variety of the mineral Lazurite, however more accurately it is a type of rock containing primarily Lazurite (25-40%), Calcite and Pyrite (also augite, diopside, enstatite, mica, hornblende, sodalite, ha√ºyne).\r\n\r\nIt has a very distinctive blue colour (due to the Lazurite). Too much pyrite causes a dull, greenish tint. In the best-quality specimens, the colour is evenly distributed, but in general it is spotty or striated.\r\n\r\nAs well as use in carvings and gems, it has been used for millennia as a blue pigment when ground to a fine powder (known as ultramarine).",
