  "Name": "Cordierite (Iolite)",
  "Description": "Cordierite was discovered in 1813 and is named after the French geologist Louis Cordier. It is also called Iolite (Greek - violet), and is sometimes misleadingly termed \"Water sapphire\".\r\n\r\nCordierite is famous for its remarkable trichroism: deep violet-blue (looking down the length of the prism) - blue-gray or yellowish-brown (when viewed through the sides). Oriented correctly Cordierite can be cut into attractive deep blue faceted gems.\r\n\r\n\"Bloodshot Iolite\" originates from Sri Lanka. It has a distinct reddish sheen or aventurescence, caused by hematite and goethite inclusions.\r\n\r\nVarieties with Cat's eye effect and weak asterism are known.",
