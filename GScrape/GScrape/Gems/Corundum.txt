  "Description": "The name \"corundum\" is derived from the Tamil word \"kuruntam\" meaning \"ruby\".\r\n\r\nCorundum is called Ruby if red and Padparadscha if pink-orange. All other colours are called Sapphire.\r\n\r\nHigh-quality ruby and sapphire have always been among the most expensive gems and are used in the most prestigious adornments.",
