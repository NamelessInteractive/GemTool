  "Name": "Boleite",
  "Description": "Boleite was named after El Boleo mine, on the Baja Peninsula, near Santa Rosalia, Mexico, where it was first collected as a very minor ore of silver, copper and lead.\r\n\r\nBoleite forms deep blue cubes over half an inch on each side, which consist of pseudo-octahedral tetragonal dipyramids.\r\n\r\nSoft, cleavable, twinned crystals of boleite are very difficult to facet.",
