  "Name": "Periclase",
  "Description": "Periclase is named after Greek \"peri\" - around and \"klasis\" - breaking, alluding to its perfect cubic cleavage.\r\n\r\nWell-developed crystals can be very attractive. Periclase is occasionally cut as gemstones, but it has limited colour range and its hardness is not particularly high.\r\n\r\nSynthetic periclase is often used as a simulant for other gemstones.",
