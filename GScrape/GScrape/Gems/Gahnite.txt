  "Name": "Gahnite",
  "Description": "Gahnite is named after J.G. Gahn, a Swedish chemist and mineralogist, who discovered the mineral. It was first described in 1807 for an occurrence in the Falu mine, Falun, Dalarna, Sweden.\r\n\r\nGahnite is a rare mineral belonging to the Spinel group. It has the same structure as Spinel but different chemistry (zinc).",
