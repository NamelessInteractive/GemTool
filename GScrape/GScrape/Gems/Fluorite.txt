  "Name": "Fluorite",
  "Description": "The word Fluorite derived from the Latin \"fluo\" - to flow, because the mineral is used as a flux in iron smelting.\r\n\r\nFluorites from certain localities exhibit a very strong fluorescence, due to impurities in the crystal. In 1852 the phenomenon of fluorescence was named after fluorite. It also gave the name to its constitutive element fluorine.\r\n\r\nFluorite has a wide range of colours, which depends on impurities, exposure to radiation, and the size of the colour centers. Colour distribution is often zonal or spotty.\r\n\r\nFluorite can be used in jewelry, cut into beads. But it is not widely used as a semiprecious stone because of its low hardness.",
