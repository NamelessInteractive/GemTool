  "Name": "Chondrodite",
  "Description": "Chondrodite is named after Greek \"chondros\" - a grain, alluding to its frequent granular appearance.\r\n\r\nTransparent to translucent orange-brown specimens exhibiting orange-brown to yellow-brown pleochroism have been reported from Sri Lanka. Transparent deep garnet-red material of gem-quality is found in the Tilly Foster mine, Brewster, New York, USA.\r\n\r\nChondrodite is one of the rarest and most beautiful of gemstones and it is occasionally faceted for collectors.",
