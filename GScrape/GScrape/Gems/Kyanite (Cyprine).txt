  "Name": "Kyanite (Cyprine)",
  "Description": "Kyanite is named after Greek word for \"blue\", because of its colour. Some fine specimens have sapphire-blue colour with violet pleochroism.\r\n\r\nKyanite has a wide variations of hardness in the same crystal depending on direction (across or along axes). It complicates the cutting of this material.\r\n\r\nCut stones reach 10 - 15 carats. Varieties with alexandrite effect and cat's eye are known.",
