  "Name": "Diaspore",
  "Description": "Diaspore is named from Greek \"diaspheirein\" - to scatter, alluding to its usual descrepitation when strongly heated.\r\n\r\nDiaspore forms greenish-brown, yellow, colourless, sometimes pinkish or white platy crystals with vitreous lustre. Some specimens may show a slight colour change from greenish in daylight to pinkish brown under tungsten light.\r\n\r\nMamaris area in Mugla Province, Turkey seems to be the source of all large gem-quality crystals that have been faceted to date.",
