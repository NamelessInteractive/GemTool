  "Name": "Uvarovite",
  "Description": "Uvarovite is one of the rarest of the garnet group minerals, and is the only consistently green garnet species, with a beautiful emerald-green color. It occurs as well-formed fine-sized crystals. It was discovered in 1832 by Germain Henri Hess who named it after Count S.S. Uvarov (1765-1855), a Russian statesman and amateur mineral collector.",
