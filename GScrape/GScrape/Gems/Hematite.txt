  "Name": "Hematite",
  "Description": "The name hematite (Greek - blood) is derived from the fact that, when cut, the saw coolant becomes coloured red. Hematite can be in reddish brown, ocherous masses, dark silvery-grey scaled masses, silvery-grey crystals, and dark-grey masses.\r\n\r\nFormerly used as mourning jewelry, but today mainly for rings, bead necklaces and intaglio (deepened engravings).",
