  "Name": "Jasper",
  "Description": "Jasper is usually considered as Chalcedony; sometimes, however, scientists put it in a group by itself within the quartz group because of its grainy structure.\r\n\r\nThe name jasper is derived from the Greek and means \"spotted stone\".\r\n\r\nThe finely grained, dense jasper contains up to 20 percent foreign materials, which determine its colour, streak, and appearance. Uniformly colored jasper is rare, usually it is multicolored, striped, or flamed. Sometimes jasper can be grown together with agate or opal. There is also some fossilized material.",
