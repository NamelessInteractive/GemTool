  "Name": "Milarite",
  "Description": "Milarite is named after its occurence in the Val Milar, Switzerland. The original specimens, however, came from Val Giuf, Tavetsch, Grischun, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nMilarite is a rare beryllium silicate, that forms transparent to translucent colourless to pale yellow or green prismatic crystals, typically well formed.\r\n\r\nA.Thomas (2009) reports: \"The small pieces of facet rough that have been cut to date have all originated from a single African source\".",
