  "Name": "Gaspéite",
  "Description": "Gaspéite is named after its discovery locality, on the Gaspé Peninsula, Lemieux Township, Gaspé-ouest County, Quebec, Canada.\r\n\r\nGaspéite occurs in translucent bright grass-green to olive- or yellowish green nodular concretions or as aggregates of rhombic crystals.\r\n\r\nGaspéite is carved into sculptures and objects d'art. It is cut into cabochons and mounted in jewelry.",
