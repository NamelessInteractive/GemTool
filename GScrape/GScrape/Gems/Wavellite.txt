  "Name": "Wavellite",
  "Description": "Wavellite is named after William Wavell, physician in Horwood Parish, Devonshire, England, who discovered the mineral.\r\n\r\nWavellite forms translucent to transparent black, brown, yellowish green to green, white to greenish white, yellow very small crystals and larger characteristic radial aggregates.\r\n\r\nWavellite is cut into attractive cabochons, slabs and other ornamental pieces.",
