{
  "Name": "Scapolite",
  "Description": "Scapolite is named after Greek word stick (in some sources \"shaft\") because of its square-section prismatic shape of the crystals.\r\n\r\nPink and violet Scapolite cat's eyes are known.\r\n\r\nIn mineralogy Scapolite refers to a group of related silicate minerals, including Meionite and Marialite. The name Wernerite is often given to Scapolite minerals intermediate between Meionite and Marialite.\r\n\r\nCut stones can reach several carats, yellow - to 70 carats and colourless - to several hundred carats.",
