  "Name": "Copal",
  "Description": "Copal is a solidified, volatile, rich plant resin, that can be colourless, yellow, brown or rarely reddish. It is a relatively recent fossil resin, which may have only tens or hundreds of years unlike Amber (millions years).\r\n\r\nCopal is frequently used as an imitation of Amber.\r\n\r\nKauri gum is a variety of Copal from New Zealand. Manila is the Copal from the Philippines and Indonesia. Dammar is a variety of Copal from Malaysia. Congo is a name for Copal from east and central Africa and Colombia where the Copal resin is sold as Colombian amber.",
