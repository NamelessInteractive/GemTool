  "Description": "Cymophane has its derivation also from the Greek words meaning 'wave' and 'appearance', in reference to the chatoyancy sometimes exhibited.\r\n\r\nCymophane is an opalescent variety of Chrysoberyl. It exhibits a bluish (or yellowish according to other sources) chatoyancy which is caused by microscopic tube-like cavities or needle-like inclusions of rutile in an orientation parallel to the c-axis.",
