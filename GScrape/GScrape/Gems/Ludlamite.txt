  "Name": "Ludlamite",
  "Description": "Ludlamite was named after Henry Ludlam, a British collector of rare minerals. It was first discovered in 1876 in Wheal Jane mine in Cornwall, England.\r\n\r\nLudlamite is a rare phosphate mineral. It forms apple- to bright green prismatic crystals. Ludlamite is occasionally faceted, but the crystals are always small.",
