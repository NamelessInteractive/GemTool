{
  "Name": "Apophyllite",
  "Description": "Apophyllite is named after Greek \"apo\" - away and \"phyllazein\" - to get leaves, alluding to its exfoliation when heated with a blowpipe. They can also be called \"fisheye stone\".\r\n\r\nApophyllite is popular because of its abundance, colour variety, and well-defined crystals, but easy cleavage, brittleness and extreme heat sensitivity make this material difficult to facet.",
