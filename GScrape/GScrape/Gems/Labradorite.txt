  "Name": "Labradorite",
  "Description": "A type of feldspar consisting of between 30-50% Albite and 50-70% Anorthite.\r\n\r\nLabradorite was named after peninsula of Labrador in Canada, where it was first found.\r\n\r\nIt shows labradorescence - a shiller effect in lustrous metallic tints, often blue and green, and sometimes the complete spectrum. This effect is caused by interference of light from lattice distortions resulting from alternating microscopic exsolution lamellae of high- and low-calcium plagioclase phases.",
