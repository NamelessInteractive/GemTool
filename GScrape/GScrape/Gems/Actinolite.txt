  "Name": "Actinolite",
  "Description": "Actinolite is named after Greek word \"aktis\" - a ray, alluding to its common occurence as radiating needles.\r\n\r\nChatoyant, translucent to opaque, green to yellowish green colour stones are cut into cabochons and called Actinolite cat's eye. Transparent well-developed crystals of actinolite are rare and are faceted into small attractive gems for collectors.",
