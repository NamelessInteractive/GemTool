  "Name": "Andesine",
  "Description": "Andesine feldspar is composed of 50-70% albite and 30-50% anorthite.\r\n\r\nAndesine was first described in 1841 for an occurrence in the Marmato mine, Colombia. It is named after the Andes mountains of South America.\r\n\r\nAndesine is found in a range of colours, from red, honey-red to orange, yellow, champagne and green.",
