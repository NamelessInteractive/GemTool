  "Name": "Clinochlore",
  "Description": "Clinochlore is named from Greek \"klinein\" - to incline, plus \"klan\" - to break, referring to its oblique basal cleavage.\r\n\r\nClinochlore forms green, yellowish, red, rose-red tabular or prismatic crystals. May also be massive, radiating, and globular masses of dense flakes.\r\n\r\nClinochlore yields attractive cabochons.",
