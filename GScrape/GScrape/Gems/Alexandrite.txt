  "Name": "Alexandrite",
  "Description": "Alexandrite is a variety of Chrysoberyl the colour of which varies between dark grass-green and emerald-green. It was named after Czar Alexander II.\r\n\r\nIt displays a color change (alexandrite effect) dependent upon the nature of ambient lighting. It is green in daylight, and light red in artificial incandescent light. To accentuate this peculiar character the stone must be cut of a certain thickness, the difference in colour being much less marked in a stone cut with little depth.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times alexandrite was found only in Russia, in the emerald mines on the right bank of the Takovaya, a small stream east of Ekaterinburg in the Urals.",
