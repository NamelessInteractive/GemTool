  "Name": "Hübnerite",
  "Description": "Hübnerite is named after Hüttenmeister Adolph Hübner, German mining engineer and metallurgist at Freiberg, Saxony.\r\n\r\nHübnerite forms transparent to translucent prismatic yellowish brown to reddish brown crystals. The crystals are typically flattened and occur with fine striations in the direction of elongation.\r\n\r\nDeep blood-red internal reflections combined with the metallic-adamantine-resinous lustre make this gem very attractive.",
