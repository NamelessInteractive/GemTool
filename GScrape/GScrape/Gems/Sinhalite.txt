  "Name": "Sinhalite",
  "Description": "The name Sinhalite is derived from the Sanskrit name for Sri Lanka - Sinhala, where it was discovered in 1952. It is a rare mineral which until recently was found only in this country.\r\n\r\nNowadays Sinhalite is also found in Mogok, Burma and pale-pink to brownish-pink crystals has been reported from Tanzania. Rough, well crystallized sinhalite up to sizes of 20 grams are being found in Madagascar.",
