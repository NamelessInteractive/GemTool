  "Name": "Beryl",
  "Description": "The name beryl comes from India and has always been associated with the gemstone. Beryl is praised for its transparency, high hardness, and beautiful colours with wide range of tones and shades.\r\n\r\nSeveral colour varieties of beryl are used as gemstones. Deep green beryls are called emeralds, greenish blue to pure blue - aquamarine, pale, almost colourless - goshenite, light yellow-green to golden-yellow - heliodor, rose and pink beryl is morganite, red variety is bixbite. Maxixe-type beryl is characterized by a bright blue colour which fades in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe crystals are prismatic, they may be very large, even gigantic and in pegmatites may reach lengths of 2 to 3 m and widths of 0.5 to 1 m.",
