  "Name": "Kornerupine",
  "Description": "Kornerupine was named after a Danish geologist and explorer A. N. Kornerup.\r\n\r\nThe colour can vary from brown, green to shades of yellow, the material is strongly pleochroic and frequently asteriated (from Burma and Taita Hills, Kenya). Cat's eye effect is due to inclusions of rutile and graphite.\r\n\r\nKornerupine can be faceted or cut into cabochons. Cut stones are up to 20 carats (usually to 3 carats).",
