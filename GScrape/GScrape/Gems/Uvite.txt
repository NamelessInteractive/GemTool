  "Name": "Uvite",
  "Description": "Uvite is named after a province in Sri Lanka. Uvite is the magnesium/iron-rich member of the group. Despite having so many coloring ions like iron and magnesium, some specimens of uvite can be colorless. The typical specimens of uvite on the mineral markets tend to be an interesting dark green to almost black in color.",
