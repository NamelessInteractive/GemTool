  "Name": "Spodumene",
  "Description": "The name refers to the mineral spodumene (Greek - ash-colored) because the common non-gem crystals are mostly opaque, white to yellowish.\r\n\r\nFor a long time gem verieties have been known as hiddenite and kunzite; since the 1970s some isolated transparent colorless varieties have been found. Most recently light yellow and green varieties have also been known.\r\n\r\nRarely displays the cat's eye effect.",
