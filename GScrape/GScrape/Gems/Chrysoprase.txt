  "Name": "Chrysoprase",
  "Description": "Chrysoprase is an attractive apple-green form of Chalcedony that is coloured by nickel. One of the most prized forms of Chalcedony.\r\n\r\nColour can fade in sunlight and when heated, colours may recover under moist storage.\r\n\r\nUsed as cabochons, for necklaces, and for ornamental objects. In earlier centuries, it was used as a luxurious decorative stone for interior decorations.",
