  "Description": "Quartz (named after a Slavic word for \"hard\") is the most common mineral found on the surface of the Earth. A significant component of many igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, this natural form of silicon dioxide is found in an impressive range of varieties and colours.",

Pink (rose quartz), charge transfer between a substitutional Ti4+ and an interstitial Ti3+ unstable color center O- ion bridging between substitutional aluminum and substitutional phosphorus atom; dumortierite inclusions.
