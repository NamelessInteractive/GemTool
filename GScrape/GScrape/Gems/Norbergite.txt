  "Description": "Norbergite is named after its discovery locality at Norberg, Sweden.\r\n\r\nNorbergite forms translucent to opaque, tan, yellow, yellow-orange, orange-brown, pink with purplish tint, white granular masses. Transparent crystals are very rare.\r\n\r\nNorbergite is often cut into cabochons.",
