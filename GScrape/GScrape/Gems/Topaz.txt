  "Name": "Topaz",
  "Description": "Topaz is named from Greek \"topazion\" for a type of gemstone, probably after Sanskrit \"tapas\" - fire, alluding to the brilliance of gem-quality material. Topaz has been known from antiquity.\r\n\r\nPure topaz is colorless and transparent but is usually tinted by impurities; typical topaz is wine, yellow, pale gray, reddish-orange, or blue brown. It can also be white, pale green, blue, gold, pink (rare), reddish-yellow or opaque to transparent/translucent.\r\n\r\nTopaz varies in value according to its quality; large crystals are found quite as frequently as small, consequently the value of cut stones is proportionate to their size. The faults, the presence of which reduces the value of a stone, are principally impure colour, fissures in the direction of cleavage and turbidity. Cavities, either vacuous or filled with liquids of various kinds, are also frequently present.",
