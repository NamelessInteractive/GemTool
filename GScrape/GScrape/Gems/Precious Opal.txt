  "Name": "Precious Opal",
  "Description": "The special characteristic of these gems is their play-of-colour, a display of rainbow-like hues, which (especially in rounded cut forms) changes with the angle of observation.\r\n\r\nOpal always contains water (3 - 30%). It can happen that in the course of time, the stone loses water, cracks, and the play-of-colour diminishes. Special care should be taken for storing it.",
