  "Name": "Phosphosiderite",
  "Description": "Phosphosiderite is named after its composition: phosphate and iron (Greek - sideros).\r\n\r\nPhosphosiderite forms small crystals up to 2.5 cm or botryoidal masses. The colour is peach-blossom-red, reddish violet, reddish purple, yellow-orange, solid pink, lavender, may be dark blue, moss-green to nearly colourless.\r\n\r\nPhosphosiderite is often cut into cabochons.",
