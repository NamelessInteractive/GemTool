  "Name": "Ruby",
  "Description": "Ruby is a pink to blood-red coloured gem variety of the mineral Corundum. The name comes from the Latin word \"ruber\" - red.\r\n\r\nThe red colour can vary within each individual deposit, therefore the determination of the source from the colour is not possible. The red colour is caused by chromium, and in case of brownish tones due to presence of iron.\r\n\r\nThe rough stone has dull and greasy lustre.\r\n\r\nInclusions are common and often indicate that the stone is natural.",
