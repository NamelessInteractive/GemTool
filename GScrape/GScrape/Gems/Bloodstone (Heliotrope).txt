  "Name": "Bloodstone (Heliotrope)",
  "Description": "Bloodstone is an opaque, dark-green Chalcedony with red spots. An old name still used in Europe is heliotrope (Greek - sun turner). Used often as seals for men's rings and for other ornamental objects.\r\n\r\nIn the trade, the term blood jasper is sometimes used. Bloodstone, however, is not a jasper at all, even though a radial structure with spherical aggregates can simulate a grainy appearance.",
