{
  "Name": "Zircon",
  "Description": "Zircon has been known since antiquity, albeit under various names. Today's name is most likely derived from the Persian language (\"golden colored\"). Because of its high refractive index and strong dispersion, it has great brilliance and intensive fire.\r\n\r\nZircons with the highest values in optical properties are designated as high zirons, those with the lowest values as low zircons. In between are the medium zircons.",
