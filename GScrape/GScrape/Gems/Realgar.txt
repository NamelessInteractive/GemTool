  "Name": "Realgar",
  "Description": "Realgar is named from Arabic \"rahj al-gar\" - powder of the mine, because it was found in a silver mine.\r\n\r\nRealgar forms red to orange-yellow prismatic crystals or granular masses. The crystals disintegrate to a powder after long exposure to light. However, this process takes a very long time. Realgar specimens should be kept in the dark, in an eclosed container.\r\n\r\nRealgar is a very rare gem. It is very soft and somewhat unstable.",
