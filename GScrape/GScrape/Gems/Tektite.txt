  "Name": "Tektite",
  "Description": "Tektite is a natural glass formed from a meteorite impact melting the local rock.\r\n\r\nMany varietal names are given to Tektites from different localities.\r\n\r\nMoldavites are oval or spherical specimens of pale or bottle-green colour with few included bubbles and less obviously flattened from the Radomilice area of southern Bohemia, Czech Republic.\r\n\r\nBikolite is a name given to Tektites from the Bikol area of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAustralites are button-shaped glass pieces found in South Australia and Tasmania. Billitonites are dark brown specimens found on Billiton Island between Sumatra and Borneo.\r\n\r\nDarwinites or Queenstownites are silica-rich and alumina-poor colourless to olive green to black specimens from Jukes-Darwin field near Queenstown, Tasmania.\r\n\r\nTektites can be distinguished from the much more abundant volcanic glasses (obsidian) by their negligible water content. A small splinter of tektite will fuse quietly in a flame to a droplet of glass, whereas a splinter of obsidian will froth up and expand in a flame owing to its small water content turning into steam.",
