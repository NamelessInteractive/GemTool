  "Name": "Moss Agate",
  "Description": "Moss agate is a colourless, translucent Dendritic Agate variety of Chalcedony with inclusions of green hornblende (or chlorite) in moss-like patterns (therefore the name).\r\n\r\nMoss agate, although primarily green, can also show brown and red patterns due to the oxidation of the iron in the hornblende/chlorite.\r\n\r\nThe name 'Agate' is generally accepted even though the stone is not banded as a true agate should be.",
