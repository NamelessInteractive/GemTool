  "Name": "Liddicoatite",
  "Description": "Liddicoatite is a calcium lithium tourmaline species, named after US gemologist R. T. Liddicoat.\r\n\r\nLiddicoatite forms green, red, pink, purple, and and blue, sometimes white, colorless, black, brown, yellow, and orange elongated prismatic crystals. Crystals are frequently multicolored, containing two or more distinct colours. It may also have internal colour zoning and banding.\r\n\r\nLarge crystals of Liddicoatite are often cut and polished into slices, with the multicolored designs and forms. Faceted material is rare because of its limited occurrences, and because most gem material is not tested to determine what type of tourmaline mineral it is - so will be labelled as Tourmaline regardless of whether it is Liddicoatite, Elbiate or another type of Tourmaline.",
