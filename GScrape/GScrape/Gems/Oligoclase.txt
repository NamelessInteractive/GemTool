  "Name": "Oligoclase",
  "Description": "A feldspar comprising 70-90% Albite and 10-30% Anorthite.\r\n\r\nThe name oligoclase derived from the Greek \"oligos\" - little, and \"clasein\" - to break, because the mineral was thought to have a less perfect cleavage than albite. This name was given by August Breithaupt in 1826.",
