  "Name": "Hibschite",
  "Description": "Hibschite is named after named after Josef Emanuel Hibsch, Tetschen, Bohemia, who found the original specimen.\r\n\r\nHibschite is a variety of grossular garnet with some replacement of hydroxyl for silica. Previously it was considered to be a discrete mineral species itself. Essentially the same as hydrogrossular.\r\n\r\nHibschite is generally white to light yellow, or may have tints of grey, green to bluish green, rarely smoky grey to black. It occurs in microscopic crystals, which may be packed together very densely.",
