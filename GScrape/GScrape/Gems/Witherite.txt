  "Name": "Witherite",
  "Description": "Witherite is named after William Withering, English physician and naturalist who originally described the mineral.\r\n\r\nCrystals are always twinned. Facetable pieces are usually small, gem rough rarely exceeds 5 grams. The translucent material is cut into cabochons.\r\n\r\nWitherite dust is toxic, it is dangerous to inhale it.",
