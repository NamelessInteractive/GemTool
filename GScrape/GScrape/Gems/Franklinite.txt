  "Description": "Franklinite is named is named after its discovery locality, at Franklin and Sterling Hill, Sussex County, New Jersey, and ultimately for Benjamin Franklin, after whom the town of Franklin was named.\r\n\r\nFranklinite forms iron-black, brown, red crystals with metallic lustre. Large crystals suitable for faceting are rare.",
