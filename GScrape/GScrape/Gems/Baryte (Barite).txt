  "Name": "Baryte (Barite)",
  "Description": "Baryte is named after Greek \"barys\" - heavy, in allusion to its high specific gravity.\r\n\r\nMany large transparent crystals have been found. Easy cleavage, brittleness and heat sensitivity of the material make it a challenge to the facetier. Cut stones rarely exceed 10 carats.",
