  "Name": "Jet",
  "Description": "Jet is an opaque black coalified fossilized drift wood of trees of the family Araucariaceae which is 180 million years old.\r\n\r\nJet is chemically related to brown coal, or lignite, but Jet is more solid and tough.\r\n\r\nJet has been used both as a talisman and a jewel for over four thousand years.\r\n\r\nJet is found in several locations around the world, but only the British and Spanish deposits have been worked commercially.",
