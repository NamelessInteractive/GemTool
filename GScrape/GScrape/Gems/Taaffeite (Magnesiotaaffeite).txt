  "Name": "Taaffeite (Magnesiotaaffeite)",
  "Description": "Taaffeite is named after E.C.R. Taaffe, gemologist of Dublin, Ireland.\r\n\r\nTaaffeite forms mauve or lilac, red to brown, bluish, green transparent to translucent crystals.\r\n\r\nA. Thomas reports that \"Taaffeite is a very rare gem mineral that was first discovered as a cut stone\". A light mauve stone was originally believed to be spinel. The source of the material was unknown for a long time, until eventually small fragents were found in Sri Lanka.\r\n\r\nA purplish brown chatoyant taaffeite has been found recently in Sri Lanka.",
