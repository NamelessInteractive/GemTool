  "Name": "Chalcedony",
  "Description": "Although in general terms Chalcedony is a fibrous cryptocrystalline variety of Quartz, recent studies have shown that much Chalcedony is a mixture of cryptocrystalline quartz and mog√°nite, another silica mineral related to quartz but with a different crystal structure.\r\n\r\nChalcedony is probably named after an ancient town at the Bosporus.",
