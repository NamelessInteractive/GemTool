  "Description": "The mineral zoisite is named after the collector Zois. It was first found in the Sau-Alp mountains in Austria, in 1805. It was originally called saualpite. Gem-stone quality specimens have only recently been found.\r\n\r\nThe gemstone members of the group are tanzanite, thulite and anyolite.",
