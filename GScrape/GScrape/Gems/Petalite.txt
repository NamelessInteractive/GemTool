  "Name": "Petalite",
  "Description": "Petalite is named after Greek \"petalon\" - leaf, because of its perfect cleavage.\r\n\r\nWell-formed crystals are rare, it is usually found in its massive form. Stones with colour are sometimes cut into cabochons. Cut petalite stones exhibit a glassy appearance and can be confused with Glass.\r\n\r\nPetalite cat's eye is known.",
