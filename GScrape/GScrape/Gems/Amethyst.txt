  "Name": "Amethyst",
  "Description": "Amethyst is the name given to purple to mauve quartz.\r\n\r\nThe name comes from the Ancient Greek (\"not intoxicated\"), a reference to the belief that the stone protected its owner from drunkenness. The ancient Greeks and Romans wore amethyst and made drinking vessels of it in the belief that it would prevent intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe range of colour includes reddish-violet tints of pale or almost colourless shades, and deep, rich tones of pure violet.",
