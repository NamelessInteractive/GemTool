  "Name": "Calcite",
  "Description": "Calcite is named after Latin \"calx\" - lime. It is a very common mineral with wide range of colours and forms.\r\n\r\nAttractive specimens are faceted or used for cabochons and carved ornamental objects.\r\n\r\nCalcite may exhibit fluorescence, phosphorescence, thermoluminescence and/or triboluminescence.",
