  "Name": "Marcasite",
  "Description": "The name Marcasite is derived from Arabic word for pyrite. Marcasite and pyrite are polymorphs. Marcasite is lighter and more brittle than pyrite.\r\n\r\nMarcasite forms metallic pale brass-yellow coloured, tabular or pyramidal, sometimes stalactic or globular crystals. On fresh surfaces it is pale yellow to almost white and has a bright metallic lustre.",
