  "Name": "Cinnabar",
  "Description": "Cinnabar is named after Greek \"kinnabaris\", the ancient name for the mineral; possibly from Arabic \"zinjafr\" or Persian \"zinjifrah\", dragon's blood, probably alluding to its colour.\r\n\r\nCinnabar usually occurs as masses or crusts. Well-formed crystals are very rare. The material has cochineal-red colour with adamantine to metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nClear cinnabar crystals are faceted into spectacular stones. Massive material is used for cabochons.",
