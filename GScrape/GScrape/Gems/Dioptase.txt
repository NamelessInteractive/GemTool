  "Name": "Dioptase",
  "Description": "Dioptase is named after Greek word for \"view through\" referring to the mineral's two cleavage directions that are visible inside unbroken crystals.\r\n\r\nDioptase is a popular collectors' mineral specimen and is smetimes cut into small emerald-like gems. The material is very soft to be worn as a ring-stone, but small specimens are sometimes mounted in pendants and brooches.",
