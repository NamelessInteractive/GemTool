{
  "Name": "Bertrandite",
  "Description": "Bertrandite is named after Emile Bertrand, mineralogist and mining engineer of Paris, France, who first called attention to the mineral.\r\n\r\nBertrandite forms transparent, colourless to pale yellow crystals. Large and clean enough crystals suitable for faceting are rare.\r\n\r\nBertrandite often occurs as a pseudomorphic replacement of beryl.",
