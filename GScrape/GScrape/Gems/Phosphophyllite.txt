  "Name": "Phosphophyllite",
  "Description": "The name Phosphophyllite reflects its phosphate content and Greek \"phyllon\" - a leaf, referring to its perfect leaf-like cleavage.\r\n\r\nPhosphophyllite forms bluish- or sea-green thick tabular crystals, fish-tail twinning is common.\r\n\r\nPhosphophyllite is highly valued by collectors for its delicate bluish green colour, but it is seldom cut because it is rare, fragile and brittle.",
