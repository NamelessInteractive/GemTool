  "Name": "Calcite Satin Spar",
  "Description": "Calcite Satin Spar was the first material to be called Satin Spar, a name now associated with a similar variety of gypsum.\r\n\r\nCalcite Satin Spar is a hard fibrous form of calcite which can take an excellent polish to give a fine satiny finish. It was first found in the last years of the 18th century near Alston in Cumbria, England.\r\n\r\nFor a short while it became a very popular decorative stone, but deposits were worked out by around 1820, and specimens are now very hard to come by.",
